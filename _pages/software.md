For the past several years, I have been working on the software project ForestClaw.  You can learn move about ForestClaw on the ForestClaw [GitHub site](http://www.github.com/ForestClaw/forestclaw).

Projects using ForestClaw  

<ul>
    <li> Volcanic ash transport using parallel, adaptive version of Ash3d. </li>
    <li> 1976 Teton Dam failure</li>
    <li> Acoustic and gravity waves in the atmosphere using MAGICForest.</li>
</ul>

I also maintain a website of [AMR software](http://www.forestclaw.org/www_personal/research/amr_software/index.html) that uses the original Berger/Oliger/Colella adaptive mesh refinement software.
