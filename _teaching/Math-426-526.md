In this course, we explore complex numbers and functions of a complex variable. Many of the ideas learned in Calculus will be revisited for complex numbers. The approach of this course will be applied, we will also discuss proofs of basic results. 

Topics
======

* Complex numbers and functions of a complex variable
* Analytic functions
* Infinite series and integration. 
* Residue Theorem, 
* Riemann Mapping Theorem
