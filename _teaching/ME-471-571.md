In this course, we will learn how to use parallel programming tools to solve problems in science and engineering. 

Basic programming skills in a compiled language such as C, C++ or Java is desirable, as is some knowledge of interpreted languages such as Python, Matlab or Julia.

Topics
======

* Parallel tools available in Python
* Basics of MPI, includin MPI I/O, derived types. 
* CUDA programming
* OpenMP. 
* Version control using Git
* Build systems using Make and CMake
* Scripting using Jupyter Notebooks. 
* Introduction to C programming for scientific computing.
