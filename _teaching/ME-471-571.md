In this course, we will learn how to use parallel programming tools to solve problems in science and engineering. 

Basic programming skills in a compiled language such as C, C++ or Java is desirable, as is some knowledge of interpreted languages such as Python, Matlab or Julia.

Topics
======

* Multiprocessing package in Python
* MPI programming in C, including Cartesian topologies, and MPI I/O
* CUDA programming
* Basic numerical methods include fractal design, iterative methods, reaction-diffusion systems
* Scripting using Jupyter Notebooks. 
* Introduction to C programming for scientific computing.
