Course Content
==============

* Floating point number systems, or Why do we worry about Numerical Analysis?
* Numerical root-finding, or How do we solve cos(x)=x ?
* Systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination and decomposition methods
* Interpolation and curve fitting, or If it looks like a parabola, it might be a cubic!
* Numerical integration

Learning Objectives
===================

By the end of this course, you should be able to 

* Understand and explain what a "floating point number system" is
* Identify root finding algorithms, and state the properties of basic algorithms, and when they can be used. 
* Outline the algorithm for Gaussian Elimination. 
* Know the different types of curve fitting - Lagrange polynomial interpolation, splines. 
* Know several numerical integration techniques.
