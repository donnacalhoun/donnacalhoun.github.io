summary: 'We propose to develop and test bases for quantification of earthquake-generated nonlinear
AGWs from their perturbations to ITM airglow layers, as complementary to TEC. We
will investigate AGWs in ITM airglow synthetic data as a possible future tool to measure the vertical surface displacements (e.g., leading to tsunami generation), which convey time- and spatially resolved insight into earthquake dynamics. Our synthetic data for ground- and space-based imaging platforms will be characterized within the context of “Solid-Earth Observational Strategies”, to “inform remote-sensing observational strategies for solid-Earth research”, leveraging feasible methodologies already being applied for Heliophysics science conducted from ground and space.'
