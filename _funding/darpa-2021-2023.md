summary: 'We combine MAGIC ("Model for Acoustic-Gravity wave Interactions and Coupling", J. Snively, and Gemini3d ("Geospace Environment Model for Ion-Neutral Interactions", M. Zettergren)) using ForestClaw to develop  state-of-the-art computational model for detecting acoustic and gravity waves in the atmosphere generated from near surface disturbances. <br><br>Funds also used for BSU Sub-Award to Heinrich Heine University (DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany)'
