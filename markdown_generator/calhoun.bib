	abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) plays a central role in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for forecasting and understanding the Earth as a system. Often these models produce results with large uncertainty and can fail to predict the intensity of weather events with desired accuracy. This is especially true for forecasting microscale wind over arbitrarily complex terrain, which is one of the least understood subjects in the atmospheric sciences, but is fundamental to many crucial problems, such as predicting microscale contaminant dispersion. Growing evidence indicates that these shortcomings arise from a combination of inadequate modeling of microscale physical processes within the Earth's atmosphere and inherent numerical errors in the CFD methods. To address these shortcomings, the PIs are developing a massively parallel, open-source CFD software package GEM3D (https://github.com/GEM3D) to study microscale atmospheric flows over complex terrain with numerical resolutions that are much finer than any current software allows. Our package uses block structured Cartesian adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) methods to provide a practical, accurate method for geometrically modeling complex terrain and large-eddy simulation techniques with novel dynamic sub-grid scale models for physically modeling incompressible flows in complex terrain. 

To make near-real time forecasting possible, the software is being designed and developed to exploit the massively parallel, multi-GPU (graphics processing unit) computing paradigm efficiently.},

	abstract = {We present a new hybrid paradigm for parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) that combines the scalability and lightweight architecture of tree-based AMR with the computational efficiency of patch-based solvers for hyperbolic conservation laws. The key idea is to interpret each leaf of the AMR hierarchy as one uniform compute patch in {R^d} with {m^d} degrees of freedom, where m is customarily between 8 and 32. Thus, computation on each patch can be optimized for speed, while we inherit the flexibility of adaptive meshes. In our work we choose to integrate with the p4est AMR library since it allows us to compose the mesh from multiple mapped octrees and enables the cubed sphere and other nontrivial multi- block geometries. We describe aspects of the parallel implementation and close with scalings for both MPI-only and OpenMP/MPI hybrid runs, where the largest MPI run executes on 16,384 CPU cores.},

	abstract = {We describe a parallel, adaptive, multiblock algorithm for explicit integration of time dependent partial differential equations on two-dimensional Cartesian grids. The grid layout we consider consists of a nested hierarchy of fixed size, non-overlapping, logically Cartesian grids stored as leaves in a quadtree. Dynamic grid refinement and parallel partitioning of the grids is done through the use of the highly scalable quadtree/octree library p4est. Because our concept is multiblock, we are able to easily solve on a variety of geometries including the cubed sphere. In this paper, we pay special attention to providing details of the parallel ghost-filling algorithm needed to ensure that both corner and edge ghost regions around each grid hold valid values.
We have implemented this algorithm in the ForestClaw code using single-grid solvers from Clawpack, a software package for solving hyperbolic PDEs using finite volumes methods. We show weak and strong scalability results for scalar advection problems on two-dimensional manifold domains on 1 to 64Ki MPI processes, demonstrating neglible regridding overhead.},

The Active Flux method is a third order accurate finite volume method for hyperbolic
conservation laws, which is based on the use of point values as well as cell average values
of the conserved quantities. The resulting method has a compact stencil in space and time
and good stability properties.

The method is implemented as a new solver in ForestClaw, a software for parallel
adaptive mesh refinement of patch-based solvers. On each Cartesian grid patch the single
grid Active Flux method can be applied. The exchange of data between grid patches is
organised via ghost cells. The local stencil in space and time and the availability of the
point values that are used for the reconstruction, leads to an efficient implementation. The
resulting method is third order accurate, conservative and allows the use of subcycling in
time.},

	abstract = {We describe a class of logically rectangular quadrilateral and hexahedral grids for solving PDEs in circular and spherical domains, including grid mappings for the circle, the sur- face of the sphere, and the three-dimensional ball. The grids are logically rectangular and the computational domain is a single Cartesian grid. Compared to alternative approaches based on a multiblock data structure o runstructured triangulations, this approach simplifies the implementation of numerical methods and the use of adaptive refinement. A more general domain with a smooth boundary can be gridded by composing one of the mappings from this paper with another smooth mapping from the circle or sphere to the desired domain. Although these grids are highly nonorthogonal, we show that the high- resolution wave-propagation algorithm implemented in clawpack can be used effectively to approximate hyperbolic problems on these grids. Since the ratio between the largest and smallest grids is below 2 for most of our grid mappings, explicit finite volume methods such as the wave-propagation algorithm do not suffer from the center or pole singularities that arise with polar or latitude-longitude grids. Numerical test calculations illustrate the potential use of these grids for a variety of applications including Euler equations, shal- low water equations, and acoustics in a heterogeneous medium. Pattern formation from a reaction-diffusion equation on the sphere is also considered. All examples are implemented in the clawpack software package and full source code is available on the web, along with MATLAB routines for the various mappings.},

	abstract = {We present a second order finite volume scheme for the constant-coefficient diffusion equation on curved parametric surfaces. While our scheme is applicable to general quadrilateral surface meshes based on smooth or piecewise smooth coordinate transformations, our primary moti- vation for developing the present scheme is to solve diffusion problems on a particular set of circular and spherical meshes introduced in [D. A. Calhoun, C. Helzel, and R. J. LeVeque, SIAM Rev., 50 (2008), pp. 723--752] for the discretization of hyperbolic problems. These grids are generated from mappings of a single Cartesian grid and were designed to have nearly uniform cells sizes and avoid the pole singularity associated with polar or spherical grid mappings. The present method for parabolic equations offers several advantages. It does not require analytic metric terms, shows second order accuracy on our disk and sphere grids, can be easily coupled to existing finite volume solvers for logically Cartesian meshes, and handles general mixed boundary conditions. Our parabolic scheme should appeal to researchers in the fields of geophysical fluid dynamics, computational biology, and any other discipline that requires the solution of parabolic equations on quadrilateral surface meshes. In this article, we present several numerical examples demonstrating the accuracy of the scheme, and then use the scheme to solve advection-reaction-diffusion equations modeling biological pattern for- mation on surfaces.},

	abstract = {We present a fully conservative, high-resolution, finite volume algorithm for advection-diffusion equations in irregular geometries. The algorithm uses a Cartesian grid in which some cells are cut by the embedded boundary. A novel feature is the use of a ``capacity function'' to model the fact that some cells are only partially available to the fluid. The advection portion then uses the explicit wave-propagation methods implemented in CLAWPACK, and is stable for Courant numbers up to 1. Diffusion is modelled with an implicit finite-volume algorithm. Results are shown for several geometries. Convergence is verified and the 1-norm order of accuracy is found to be- tween 1.2 and 2 depending on the geometry and Peclet number.},

This analysis is performed by extending with sensitivity equations the set of differential equations describing the dynamical system. These additional equations require the evaluation of partial derivatives, and so a technique known as the table algorithm, which can be used to exactly and automatically compute these derivatives, is described. A C++ class which can be used to implement the table algorithm is presented along with a driver routine for evaluating the output of a model and its sensitivity to a single parameter. The use of this driver routine is illustrated with a specific application from environmental hazards modeling.},

	abstract = {We describe a method for solving the two-dimensional Navier--Stokes equations in irregular physical domains. Our method is based on an underlying uniform Cartesian grid and second-order finite-difference/finite-volume discretizations of the streamfunction-vorticity equations. Geometry representing stationary solid obstacles in the flow domain is embedded in the Cartesian grid and special discretizations near the embedded boundary ensure the accuracy of the solution in the cut cells. Along the embedded boundary, we determine a distribution of vorticity sources needed to impose the no-slip flow conditions. This distribution appears as a right-hand-side term in the discretized fluid equations, and so we can use fast solvers to solve the linear systems that arise. To handle the advective terms, we use the high-resolution algorithms in CLAWPACK. We show that our Stokes solver is second-order accurate for steady state solutions and that our full Navier--Stokes solver is between first- and second-order accurate and reproduces results from well-studied benchmark problems in viscous fluid flow. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of our code on flow in a complex domain.},

The two codes were developed independently, but are based on essen- tially the same mathematical model, so a comparison of the results using realistic parameters is thought to be a good verification and validation of both codes. In this report, we do five test cases, and show that the re- sults between the two codes are in excellent agreement. We conclude that either code is suitable for most realistic problems, although the transient code may have problems with stiffness for cracks with very cold walls, in which condensation occurs very fast.},

	abstract = {Active Learning (AL) is a methodology from Ma- chine Learning and Design of Experiments (DOE) in which the quantities of interest are measured sequentially and the corresponding surrogate models are constructed incrementally. AL provides compelling optimizations over static DOE in ap- plications with engineering processes where the cost of individ- ual experiments is significant. It also helps perform series of computer experiments in parameter sweeps and performance analysis studies. One of the non-trivial tasks in the design of AL systems is the selection of algorithms for cost-efficient exploration of the input spaces of interest: AL needs to balance ``exploitation'' of experiments with modest costs and careful ``exploration'' of expensive configurations. Finding this balance in an automatic and general manner is challenging yet desirable in practice.
In this paper, we investigate the application of AL algorithms to Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) performed on a supercom- puter. We use AL in conjunction with Gaussian Process Regres- sion for the incremental modeling of cost and memory usage of a series of AMR simulations of a shock-bubble interaction phenomenon. In the studied 5-dimensional input parameter space -- with physical, numerical, and machine parameters -- we allow AL to guide experimentation across hundreds of configurations. We develop and evaluate a novel multi-objective AL experiment selection algorithm which prioritizes cost-efficient exploration of available configurations and at the same time avoids simulations that violate memory constraints.},

	year = {2006},
	abstract = {Knowledge of tree crown information is critical to the modeling of forest fires. For example, FARSITE, one of the most commonly used fire simulators, uses crown volume to estimate crown fire behavior. Conventionally, tree crown volume is estimated using plot-level regression models from LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data of the canopy structure. Convectional approaches, however, tend to result in rough estimations of crown volume. A more accurate method for computing single stand-level crown volume from LIDAR data would result in improving species characterization, automating tree identification from LIDAR data, and simulating fire behavior more precisely than conventional approaches. In this research, we propose a novel technique which more accurately computes individual tree crown volume from LIDAR data. First, we identify individual trees from unorganized LIDAR data points using a level set method, a shortest path algorithm and known GPS points for the stem locations. Second, we use radial basis functions (RBFs) to reconstruct implicit surfaces approximating individual tree crown shapes. These implicit surfaces, which effectively "wrap" each tree crown, are used to reconstruct a Digital Surface Model (DSM) of the canopy and to estimate individual tree crown volume.},

	abstract = {Forest structure data derived from lidar is being used in forest science and management for inventory analysis, biomass estimation, and wildlife habitat analysis. Regression analysis dominated previous approaches to the derivation of tree stem and crown parameters from lidar. The regression model for tree parameters is locally applied based on vertical lidar point density, the tree species involved, and stand structure in the specific research area. The results of this approach, therefore, are location-specific, limiting its applicability to other areas. For a more widely applicable approach to derive tree parameters,we developed an innovative method called `wrapped surface reconstruction' that employs radial basis functions and an isosurface. Utilizing computer graphics, we capture the exact shape of an irregular tree crown of various tree species based on the lidar point cloud and visualize their exact crown formation in three-dimensional space. To validate the tree parameters given by our wrapped surface approach, survey-grade equipment (a total station)was used to measure the crown shape. Four vantage points were established for each of 55 trees to capture whole-tree crown profiles georeferenced with post-processed differential GPS points. The observed tree profiles were linearly interpolated to estimate crown volume. These fieldwork-generated profiles were compared with the wrapped surface to assess goodness of fit. For coniferous trees, the following tree crown parameters derived by the wrapped surface method were highly correlated (pb0.05) with the total station-derived measurements: tree height (R2=0.95), crown width (R2=0.80), live crown base (R2=0.92), height of the lowest branch (R2=0.72), and crown volume (R2=0.84). For deciduous trees,wrapped surface-derived parameters of tree height (R2=0.96), crownwidth (R2=0.75), live
crown base (R2=0.53), height of the lowest branch (R2=0.51), and crown volume (R2=0.89) were correlated with the total station-derived measurements. The wrapped surface technique is less susceptible to errors in estimation of tree parameters because of exact interpolation using the radial basis functions. The effect of diminished energy return causes the low correlation for lowest branches in deciduous trees (R2=0.51), even though leaf-off lidar data was used. The wrapped surface provides fast and automated detection of micro-scale tree parameters for specific applications in areas such as tree physiology, fire modeling, and forest inventory.},

Here we present results from 19 state- of-the-art transport scheme formulations based on finite- difference/finite-volume methods as well as emerging (in the context of atmospheric/oceanographic sciences) Galerkin methods. Discretization grids range from traditional regular latitude--longitude grids to more isotropic domain discretizations such as icosahedral and cubed-sphere tessellations of the sphere. The schemes are evaluated using a wide range of diagnostics in idealized flow environments. Accuracy is assessed in single- and two-tracer configurations using conventional error norms as well as novel diagnostics designed for climate and climate--chemistry applications. In addition, algorithmic considerations that may be important for computational efficiency are reported on. The latter is inevitably computing platform dependent.},

The novelty is the use of a fast solver for the free space heat equation to compute the thermal field. This solver is based on the efficient direct evaluation of the integral representation of the solution to the constant coefficient, free space heat equation with a smooth source term. The computational cost and memory requirements of the new solver are reasonable and no artificial boundary conditions are needed. This allows one to solve for the thermal field in a computational domain whose size depends only on the size of the growing crystal and not on the extent of the thermal field, which can result in significant computational savings in the low undercooling regime. },

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00766},
	year = {2022},
	abstract = {Dam failures occur worldwide, often from factors including aging structures, extreme hydrologic loading, and design oversights related to the changing climate. Understanding and mitigating risk to downstream inhabited areas require developing and improving low-cost high-fidelity tools, such as numerical models, which allow emergency managers to predict the consequences of dam failures better. Two-dimensional (2D) depth- averaged hydraulic models can provide valuable insights into the importance of breach parameters or downstream flow characteristics, but historical studies considering historic failures using real topographies are less common in literature. This study compares GeoClaw, a 2D hydraulic model with novel adaptive mesh refinement capabilities, to an industry standard software HEC-RAS (Hydrologic Engineering Center - River Analysis System) using the 1976 Teton Dam failure as a case study. The suitability of GeoClaw for dam failure modeling is determined based on its capability to resolve inundation extent and flood wave arrival times. This study performs sensitivity analyses of the HEC-RAS model to compare an instantaneous dam breach assumption with a time-dependent breach formation for quantifying the model uncertainty. We find the 2D GeoClaw dam-break model results compare reasonably with historical gauge records and field observational data and HEC-RAS results. The model demonstrates stability and relatively low computational
costs. Our findings highlight opportunities for future work, with the GeoClaw software performance supporting continued studies to evaluate performance. Outcomes of this study will assist dam owners, floodplain managers, and emergency managers by providing an additional tool for estimating the impacts of dam failures to protect lives and infrastruc-
ture downstream.

	abstract = {We present a new microphysical model for the vapor growth and aspect ratio evolution of faceted, hexagonal ice crystals in the atmosphere. Our model is based on a novel, efficient numerical method for solving Laplace's equation for steady state diffusion on the surface of a three-dimensional hexagonal prism, and also takes into account the surface kinetic processes of crystal growth. We do not include ventilation, so our model is limited to stationary crystals or falling crystals smaller than 100 micron. We calculate a self-consistent solution for the distribution of the supersaturation and the condensation coefficient on each crystal face, for several different assumptions regarding the crystal growth mechanism and ice surface properties. We use this model to predict the aspect ratios expected for faceted ice crystals over a range of temperatures and supersaturations, as well as to estimate the conditions for which faceted growth becomes unstable and the crystals become hollowed or dendritic. We compare these predictions to observed features of ice cloud crystals to infer some microphysical characteristics of ice crystals and their temperature dependence. We also compare our predicted mass growth rates with those of the capacitance model for spheres and ellipsoids to look at the effects of shape and surface kinetics. Finally, we insert the single-particle code into a simple parcel cloud model to investigate the feedbacks between crystal surface kinetics, shape, and the thermodynamic properties of clouds.},
