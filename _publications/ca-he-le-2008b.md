abstract: 'This volume contains papers that were presented at HYP2006, the eleventh international Conference on Hyperbolic Problems: Theory, Numerics and Applications held at the Ecole Normale Sup{\&apos;e}rieure de Lyon, France, July 17-21, 2006. This biennial series of conferences has become one of the most important international events in Applied Mathematics. As computers became more and more powerful, the interplay between theory, modelling, and numerical algorithms gained considerable impact, and the scope of HYP conferences expanded accordingly. The field is currently in interaction with a variety of scientific domains, including fluid dynamics, physics, electromagnetism, chemistry, biology, road and network traffic, and engineering. Many of these papers present new effective numerical methods and their application in various contexts.'
