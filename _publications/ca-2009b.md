abstract: 'In this follow-up report, we complete the comparisons of the transient air- steam-water mixture flow formulation and the Cast3M operator Fiss. The two codes were developed independently, but are based on essen- tially the same mathematical model, so a comparison of the results using realistic parameters is thought to be a good verification and validation of both codes. In this report, we do five test cases, and show that the re- sults between the two codes are in excellent agreement. We conclude that either code is suitable for most realistic problems, although the transient code may have problems with stiffness for cracks with very cold walls, in which condensation occurs very fast.'
