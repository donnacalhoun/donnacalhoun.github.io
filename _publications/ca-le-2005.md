abstract: 'We test a high-resolution wave-propagation algorithm for hyperbolic conservation laws on mapped quadrilateral and hexahedral grids in the context of adaptive mesh refinement. We discuss some of the issues related to using non-Cartesian grids with AMR and study a test problem in which a grid refinement interface is fixed in space on a highly skewed portion of a mapped grid. Smooth and shock-wave solutions to the Euler equations are used to investigate the possibility that spurious reflections or other numerical errors might be generated at a grid interface.'
