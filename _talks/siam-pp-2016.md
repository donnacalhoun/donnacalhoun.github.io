abstract: 'We discuss recent parallel results using ForestClaw, an adaptive code based on the Berger-Oliger-Colella patch-based scheme for solving hyperbolic conservation laws coupled with the quad/octree mesh refinement available in p4est (C. Burstedde).  We show how parallel communications costs vary across different refinement strategies and patch sizes and detail the strategies we use to minimize these communication costs.  Results will be shown for several hyperbolic problems, including shallow water wave equations on the cubed sphere.'
