abstract: 'We describe current efforts to develop ForestClaw, a hybrid AMR finite volume code based on wave propagation algorithms in which non-overlapping fixed-size Cartesian grids are stored as leaves in a forest of quad- or oct-trees. The tree-based code p4est manages the multi-block connectivity and is highly scalable in realistic applications. In joint work with researchers at the Cascade Volcanic Observatory (L. Mastin and H. Schwaiger, CVO, Vancouver, WA), we will present results from our efforts to use ForestClaw for modeling the transport of volcanic ash in the atmosphere.'
