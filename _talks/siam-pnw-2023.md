abstract: 'Large scale geophysical simulations place extreme computatational demands on computing platforms.  Parallel computing capabilities are essential, and the use of accelerators (e.g. GPUs) for these applications are becoming more common.   On the software side, there is continued effort to develop faster and more accurate solvers, as well as improve software engineering practices that can take advantage of the latest compilers and languages.    Our software platform, ForestClaw (D. Calhoun and C. Burstedde) provides parallel, adaptive capabilities for finite volume solvers on a nested hierarchy of logically Cartesian grids.  This talk will focus on using ForestClaw to accelerate geophysical simulations through the efficient use of both parallel, adaptive meshing, GPUs and coupled simulations. We will demonstrate applications from tsunami modeling, overland flooding, volcanic eruptions and ash transport, and wildfire smoke transport. '
