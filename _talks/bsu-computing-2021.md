abstract: 'Many physical phenomena can be described using conservation laws that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, energy and other physical quantities of interest.   These laws can then be converted to a set of model equations which can be used to model the spatial and temporal evolution of physical quantities.  When solving these equations numerically, we use “finite volume” schemes which capture, at a discrete level, the conservative properties embodied in the physical laws.  In this talk, I’ll introduce the theory behind hyperbolic systems, and finite volume schemes, and then describe how we use it to solve problems in a variety of problems in geophysics.  Of particular interest are problems on curved surfaces such as the sphere.  I’ll also talk about the ForestClaw the parallel, adaptive software platform I have been developed.
