abstract: 'Numerical simulations of acoustic-gravity wave (AGW) processes in the deep atmosphere are complicated by the wide range of scales involved. Small-to-medium-scale AGWs, with wavelengths ~10s-100s km and periods of several-to-tens of minutes, interact with structure dynamics ranging from sub-km to global scales. It remains infeasible to capture all relevant scales and processes in single domains, e.g., to comprehensively resolve turbulent eddies, radiation of secondary AGWs into the thermosphere, and interactions with tides (e.g., Heale et al., JGR, 122(2), 2017; GRL, 43(26), 2019; Bossert et al., JGR, 122(15), 2017). Stretched domains (e.g., Fritts et al., AGU FM, 2017) can capture the horizontal extents of wave fields, allowing higher resolution where needed. However, numerical strategies that control resolution in all dimensions at high altitudes provide further benefit, dramatically reducing the cost of over-resolved solutions in the diffusive thermosphere. Our approach is to apply adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), albeit with the needs to mitigate transients and to define refinement criteria that still capture nonlinear evolutions. We report recent progress on the numerics and underlying model physics of the Model for Acoustic-Gravity wave Interactions and Coupling (Zettergren and Snively, JGR, 120(9), 2015, and references therein). MAGIC is now implemented in ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, arXiv:1703.03116, 2017), which is an AMR and solver library, using p4est mesh management (Burstedde et al., SIAM JSC, 33(3), 2011), and Clawpack solvers (Clawpack Development Team, 2002-2020; LeVeque, JCP, 131, 1997). “MAGIC Forest” thus includes the full feature set of 2D MAGIC, with its latest numerics, enabling AMR for surface-to-space (0-400+ km) AGW dynamics in large (~1000s km) domains, with calculation of species densities and airglow observables. We also introduce the new 3D MAGIC Forest in an “extruded mesh” form that leverages 2D AMR in the horizontal directions. We discuss the scalability and performance characteristics of these new models, leveraging AMR to achieve high resolutions only where needed, achieving up to orders-of-magnitude speedups. We demonstrate applications in long-range, multi-scale AGW propagation and coupling across deep altitude spans and extensions to the ionosphere.'
