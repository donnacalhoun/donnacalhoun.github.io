abstract: 'We will discuss recent multiblock and parallel capabilities in ForestClaw, an adaptive mesh refinement code based on the patched-based multi-rate Berger-Oliger algorithmic strategy coupled with quad/octree mesh refinement.  The support for multiblock capabilities now allows for domains composed of  quadrilaterals, (with up to four quads meeting at a vertex), each of which is refined as a quadtree.  One important example of such a domain is the cubed sphere.  We will also show results from parallel computations on the Blue Gene/Q supercomputer JUQUEEN, based in Julich, Germany.  ForestClaw uses the dynamic grid management library p4est (C. Burstedde, Univ. of Bonn).'
