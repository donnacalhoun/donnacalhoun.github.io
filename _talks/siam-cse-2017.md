abstract: 'Using the GeoClaw software package, we model the 1976 Teton Dam failure that led to massive flooding in eastern Idaho, The flood boundaries reported by \geoclaw show excellent agreement with the boundaries recorded by the USGS at the time of the event and with historical descriptions of the dam failure.  Performance results for recent work on developing a GeoClaw extension of ForestClaw, a parallel library based on p4est for solving PDEs on adaptive Cartesian meshes will also be reported.'
