abstract: 'Adaptive, Cartesian grid methods have been used very effectively in the modeling of tsunamis, landslides, flooding, debris flows and other phenomena in which the computational domain can be reasonably approximated by a logically Cartesian mesh.  One such code, GeoClaw (D. George, R. J. LeVeque, K. Mandli, M. Berger), is already part of the CSDMS model repository.  A new code, ForestClaw, a parallel library based on adaptive quadtrees, has been extended with the  GeoClaw library.  This GeoClaw extension of ForestClaw gives GeoClaw users distributed parallelism and a C-interface for enhanced interoperability with other codes, while maintaining the core functionality of GeoClaw.  We will describe the basic features of the ForestClaw code (www.forestclaw.org) and present results using the GeoClaw extension of ForestClaw to model the 1976 Teton Dam failure.  If time permits, we will also describe on-going work to model dispersion and transport of volcanic ash using the Ash3d (H. Schweiger, R. Denlinger, L. Mastin, Cascade Volcanic Observatory, USGS) extension of ForestClaw.'
