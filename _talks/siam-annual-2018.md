abstract: 'We discuss at least four different methods for formulating the wave propagation algorithm used in Clawpack (R. J. LeVeque) for the variable coefficient conservative advection equation on a finite volume mesh.  Both cell-centered and face-centered velocities are considered, and first and  second order schemes.  Of special interest is the treatment of sonic  points where converging or diverging flows can lead to loss of  hyperbolicity.  We demonstrate the approaches on volcanic ash transport  simulations, and if time permits, we discuss the correction terms needed  to maintain conservation on adaptive mapped grids and surface meshes.'
